# ExportErr
Updated 4 hours ago
This project is my first project in Java. He was immediately created for a real task on my current work. The program collects from the Download folder the export files of payment terminals downloaded from several payment systems and creates a single file from them, which can be exported to the payment terminal accounting program (this program was developed for only one PS). Also, the search for the address by the terminal number was added to the project (using the local Excel table).
